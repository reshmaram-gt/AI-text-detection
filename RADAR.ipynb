In general, the older layer was exposed to erosion for an interval of time before deposition of the younger layer, but the term is used to describe any break in the sedimentary geologic record.  The significance of angular unconformity (see below) was shown by James Hutton, who found examples of Hutton's Unconformity at Jedburgh in 1787 and at Siccar Point in 1788. The rocks above an unconformity are younger than the rocks beneath (unless the sequence has been overturned). An unconformity represents time during which no sediments were preserved in a region or were subsequently eroded before the next deposition. The local record for that time interval is missing and geologists must use other clues to discover that part of the geologic history of that area.  The interval of geologic time not represented is called a hiatus. It is a kind of relative dating.\",\n","  \"An unconformity is a buried erosional or sedimentary surface that is not exposed at the surface of the Earth's crust.

History \\nKIRKSVILLE GETS TUF: In late 1981 Admiral Broadcasting Incorporated, under the direction of CEO Irving Davis, petitioned the Federal Communications Commission for licensing & broadcasting rights for the call letters KTUF on frequency 93.5 FM assigned to the city of Kirksville, Missouri under FCC Docket 80-90. Approval was granted in 1982 and work soon began to establish a broadcasting studio and office, as well as rental of tower antenna space. Just after the start of 1983 an innovative marketing campaign began for the new station featuring photos of various citizens and local celebrities wearing boxing gloves and the slogan \"Kirksville Gets Tuf. Punch 93.5 K-TUF\". While sweethearts were giving each other flowers and candy on Valentine\\'s Day, February 14, 1983 saw the gift of a new radio station to the northeast Missouri airwaves as KTUF signed on for the stations first day of broadcasting. The music format at sign-on was Top 40/CHR with a slightly heavier rock/AOR influence during the evening and overnight hours. In 1988, Admiral Broadcasting received FCC approval to increase broadcasting power from the original 3,000 watts on frequency 93.5 to 50,000 watts on frequency 93.7 from a newly constructed tower on the eastern edge of Kirksville. The increased power greatly expanded KTUF\\'s reachable audience from Adair County, Missouri and its bordering counties, into large portions of northcentral Missouri and southeast Iowa. The music format also changed somewhat, with less emphasis on rock and metal—with the exception of those artist found on the Top 40 music charts.',\n","  \"KTUF (93.7 FM) is a radio station broadcasting a Top 40 format.

Hobie also designed a successful monohull, the Hobie 33. History\\nThe company founder, Hobart Alter, began as a surfboard manufacturer in the late 1950s. \\nAccording to another source, Alter\\'s focus changed in 1961 to designing an easily beached fiberglass catamaran.\\nThe impetus of this shift is attributed to a 1961 boat show in Anaheim, CA which placed Alter in a booth selling surfboards, next to Art Javes, the designer of the new (1961) AQUA CAT 12 sailboat. That sailboat featured lightweight fiberglass hulls with an aluminium tube structure supporting a trampoline style deck for seating. The AQUA CAT catamaran did well in shallow water, but relied on dagger boards to reduce slippage side wise under sail. Dagger boards were also used by the much heavier Pacific Cat from 1960. That design featured a solid fiberglass deck on a 19-foot × 8-foot boat, giving it a weight of almost 500 pounds. Following the 1961 boat show, Alter contacted Arthur \"Art\" Javes, designer of the AQUA CAT to tell him he was also entering the fledgling catamaran market. The first Hobie Cat is credited with being first built in 1965 and featured a structure similar to the AQUA CAT, but slightly heavier with asymmetrically-shaped hulls that did not rely on dagger boards. This design was more readily beached than the AQUA CAT or Pacific Cat.',\n","  'The Hobie Cat is a small sailing catamaran, designed by Hobie Cat Enterprises of Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
